# Plants/Fungi

Campus is home to many fantastic plant species! Below we will explore just a few of our favorites. 

## Horse Chestnut
Horse chestnut is a majestic tree that can reach up to 100 feet tall. It is a native species of the Balkans and was introduced to other parts of Europe and North America in the 16th century. Horse chestnut provides food and shelter for a variety of animals, including bees, birds, squirrels, and deer. For the microbio majors out there, it can be used to extract aesculin, a glucoside that is hydrolyzed by Enterococcus making it useful for detection assays! Its large leaves and abundant flowers contribute to soil health and reduce erosion. Overall, horse chestnut is an intriguing plant with a rich cultural and ecological significance that deserves our attention and protection.

## Silvery Cinquefoil
Silvery cinquefoil is a striking silver-leaved plant that looks like it's out of a fairytale. This subalpine plant has delicate five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in dense clusters on long stems that reach about 20 cm tall. The angled, five-toothed leaves are covered with fine silver hairs on the bottom, creating a unique shimmering effect that catches the eye. Despite its small size and delicate appearance, silvery cinquefoil is a tough survivor that thrives in harsh, rocky environments. It's a plant that embodies the magic and resilience of nature; despite its alluring appearance, it is considered a pest as it is an introduced species from Eurasia.

## Bittersweet Nightshade
Bittersweet nightshade is a fascinating perennial plant that belongs to the nightshade family. This plant boasts small, star-shaped purple or white flowers that give way to shiny, red berries. Beware, though, as their bright and juicy berries can be tempting, their hollow stem and leaves contain a bitter toxin that can cause nausea, vomiting, and even hallucinations. Native to Asia and Europe, bittersweet nightshade has a long history of traditional medicinal use, but it is also a standout in the world of ecology. Due to its aggressive nature and ability to adapt to a wide range of habitats, bittersweet nightshade is classified as an invasive species in many regions including the Thompson-Okanagan. So while its beauty and intrigue may be captivating, it's important to remember that bittersweet nightshade is a complex and potentially dangerous plant that serves as a reminder of the delicate balance of our natural world. Be sure to be on the lookout next time you take a study break around the pound behind EME!
