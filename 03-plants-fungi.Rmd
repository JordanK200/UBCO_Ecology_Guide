# Plants/Fungi

## Horse Chestnut
Horse chestnut (*Aesculus hippocastanum*) is a large tree that can reach up to 100 feet tall. It is a native species of the Balkans and was introduced to other parts of Europe and North America in the 16th century. Horse chestnut provides food and shelter for a variety of animals, including bees, birds, squirrels, and deer. For the microbio majors out there, it can be used to extract aesculin, a glucoside that is hydrolyzed by Enterococci making it useful for detection assays! Although the fruits of this tree look similar to chestnuts, they should not be eaten! The fruits contain large amounts of saponins which are toxic to humans...

## Bonnets
Bonnets (Genus *Mycena*) are marvels of nature! These beautiful, bulbous fungi are a vital part of our local ecological web, providing nourishment and shelter for a wide array of creatures. Some species of bonnets are also known to have medicinal properties, making them valuable not just for their ecological role. The edibility of these mushrooms varies across species, so maybe donâ€™t use them for your ravioli. Take a moment to appreciate the intricate beauty of bonnets as you walk along the EME pond or Old Pine Trail, and you'll see just how cool and interesting these plants are.

## Silvery Cinquefoil
Silvery cinquefoil (*Potentilla argentea*) is a striking silver-leaved plant that looks like it's out of a fairytale. This subalpine plant has delicate five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in dense clusters on long stems that reach about 20 cm tall. The angled, five-toothed leaves are covered with fine silver hairs on the bottom, creating a unique shimmering effect that catches the eye. Silvery cinquefoil is an invasive species that originates from Eurasia. It thrives in harsh, rocky environments. Despite its alluring appearance, silvery cinquefoil is considered a pest in BC.

## Bittersweet Nightshade
Bittersweet nightshade (*Solanum dulcamara*) is a fascinating perennial plant that belongs to the nightshade family, which includes many common vegetables such as tomatoes, aubergines, potatoes, and bell peppers! This plant boasts small, star-shaped purple or white flowers that give way to shiny, red berries. Beware, though, as their bright and juicy berries can be tempting, their hollow stem and leaves contain a bitter toxin that can cause nausea, vomiting, and hallucinations. Native to Asia and Europe, bittersweet nightshade has a long history of traditional medicinal use, but it is also a standout in the world of ecology. Due to its aggressive nature and ability to adapt to a wide range of habitats, bittersweet nightshade is classified as an invasive species in many regions including the Thompson-Okanagan. So while its beauty and intrigue may be captivating, it's important to remember that bittersweet nightshade is a complex and extremely dangerous plant that serves as a reminder of the delicate balance of our natural world. Be sure to be on the lookout next time you take a study break around the pound behind EME!

## Wolf Lichen
Wolf lichen (*Letharia vulpina*) is a lichen, which means that it is actually two organisms! Lichens are composite organisms made from symbiotic partnerships between fungi and algae. Wolf Lichen is yellow-green in colour, shrubby and highly branched. It most often grows on the bark of living and dead conifers. The pigment that gives wolf lichen its yellow colour (vulpinic acid) is slightly toxic to mammals. The toxic pigment was used historically to poison wolves, which is the inspiration for the name wolf lichen.
