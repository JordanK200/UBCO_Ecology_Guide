# Insects (Invertebrates)

## Knapweed Root Weevil
The knapweed root weevil (*Cyphocleonus Achates*) is a fascinating species of weevil that has captured the attention of ecologists and entomologists alike. This beetle has a unique ability to control invasive plant populations, specifically knapweeds. They are used in BC as a biocontrol agent; meaning that while they are an introduced species they are actually beneficial to the ecosystem since they consume and control populations of invasive knapweeds that can outcompete native species as well as taking up nutrients from the soil that can be used by livestock and crops.

## European Mantis

While this member of the Mantidae family may seem delicate, it is anything but; from the female eating the maleâ€™s head after mating to the fact that it is an invasive species to North America, the European mantis (*Mantis religiosa*) is quite the pest. It was first introduced into North America in the 1900s as a biocontrol agent for gypsy moths but has since spread throughout the continent. This rapid spreading presents an ecological problem as the mantis predates native insects, disrupting local ecosystems.

## Asian Lady Bug
The Asian ladybug (*Harmonia axyridis*) is a captivating insect that has become a common sight in North America, including right here on campus. Originally introduced as a biological control for pests, such as aphids, this ladybug has since become well-established in many regions. These insects are quite different from the native ladybugs that most people are familiar with, as they can vary in coloration from orange to black and even have spots or stripes. They also have a peculiar habit of aggregating in large numbers during the fall, often seeking shelter in buildings and homes. While they may provide some benefits as predators of pests, their impact on native ladybug species and potential harm to agricultural crops is still being studied by ecologists.

## California Broad Necked Beetle
The California broad-necked beetle (*Coelocnemis dilaticollis*) is a stunning insect that is native to the western region of North America. This beetle is around 12-15mm in length and has a unique shape that sets it apart from other beetles. Its broad, flattened neck gives it an almost distinct hourglass shape and its metallic green coloration adds to its beauty. The California broad-necked beetle can usually be found on the flowers and foliage of oak trees, primarily in the late spring and early summer months. It serves as an important part of the ecosystem by pollinating and aiding in the decomposition process. Sightings have been spread all throughout campus even up on Old Pine Trail so watch your step!
